Bankist Application

This application simulates a banking application with user log-ins, requesting loans from the "bank", transferring funds to other accounts, and visualizing the transaction activity of the account. To test the application, there are two accounts to work with.

Username: js pin: 1111
Username: jd pin: 2222

You can log-in to one of the above accounts to test the application.
